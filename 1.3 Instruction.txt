The public NIR testing data were from the appendix of the published articles [1,2].

¢Ù This data set consists of 80 samples of corn measured on 3 different NIR spectrometers, we anlysis one NIR spectrometer: m5spec. The wavelength range is 1100-2498nm at 2 nm intervals (700 channels). 
The moisture, oil, protein and starch values for each of the samples is also included. A number of NBS glass standards were also measured on each instrument. 
The data was originally taken at Cargill. Many thanks for Mike Blackburn for letting us distribute it.
